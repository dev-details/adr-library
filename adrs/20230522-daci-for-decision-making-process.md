- Status: accepted

- Approvers: {who approves the decision}
- Contributors: {whose input is sought (two-way communication)}
- Informed: {who is kept up-to-date on progress (one-way communication)}

# DACI for Decision-Making Process

## Context and Problem Statement

Our team is continuously seeking ways to refine our decision-making
processes. We believe clearer roles and responsibilities in this 
process will enhance efficiency, minimize misunderstandings, and 
foster collaboration.

## Decision Drivers

- Clarity of roles -- who is involved in making decisions and who is impacted.
- Simple -- must be easy to explain and understand.

## Considered Options

* DACI
* RACI
* RAPID

## Decision Outcome

We will adopt the [DACI](https://www.productplan.com/glossary/daci/)
framework for our decision-making process. DACI stands for:

- **D**river: Person driving the project and responsible for the
  decision-making process. This person should understand the project 
  and facilitate communication among stakeholders.

- **A**pprovers: Individual(s) with the final say. Typically, 
  individuals in this role possess the authority to make decisions.

- **C**ontributors: Those providing valuable input to the decision. 
  Contributors can be anyone with relevant information or expertise.

- **I**nformed: People who need to be aware of the decision once made.
  These could be team members impacted by the decision or other 
  stakeholders.

At a minimum, we will apply DACI to:

1. Design Documents: To decide on the best design approach.
2. Any/Architectural Decision Records (ADRs): To drive decision-making
   for system-wide changes.

## Pros and Cons of the Options

### RACI

[RACI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix) 
stands for Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. While it 
provides a similar structure to DACI, the difference in terms can sometimes
lead to ambiguity, such as distinguishing between "Responsible" and 
"Accountable".

### RAPID

[RAPID](https://www.bridgespan.org/insights/rapid-decision-making) 
stands for Recommend, Agree, Perform, Input, and Decide. This model 
emphasizes decision execution but can be overly complex, especially 
for smaller teams and less hierarchical organizations.

## Consequences

Adopting DACI is expected to enhance our decision-making process, 
promoting clarity and efficiency. It requires a learning period and 
may necessitate adjustments in our workflows. Ultimately, it's 
anticipated to cultivate a more transparent and efficient environment.

### Suggestions for Adoption

To migrate to DACI, we can:

1. **Present**: Conduct sessions to familiarize the team with DACI.
2. **Implement Incrementally**: Begin with one project and gradually
   expand its usage.
3. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule reviews to assess DACI effectiveness 
   and make adjustments.
